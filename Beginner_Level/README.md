# 🏠 Boston House Price Prediction

This is a **Beginner Level** machine learning project completed as part of the **Sadowfox Internship**.

The goal of this project is to predict house prices in Boston using various features like crime rate, number of rooms, distance to employment centers, and more. We used a regression model to make these predictions.

Language Model Deployment and Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing a Language Model (LM) using Python. The goal is to understand the workflow of LM deployment, evaluate its performance, and analyze its capabilities in natural language processing (NLP).

The notebook includes:

Text preprocessing

Model training and evaluation

Accuracy measurement

Output generation and interpretation

🚀 Features

Preprocesses input text for model readiness

Implements a moderate-level LM (not too basic, not overly advanced)

Evaluates performance using accuracy and loss metrics

Generates predictions from trained model

Easy-to-follow code for educational purposes

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on chosen LM implementation)
